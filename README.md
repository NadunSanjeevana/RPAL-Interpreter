## Introduction

Welcome to the RPAL Interpreter repository! This project is an implementation of an interpreter for RPAL (Recursive Programming Algorithmic Language), a functional programming language. The interpreter parses and executes RPAL code, making it a valuable tool for understanding and working with RPAL programs.

## Features

- **RPAL Interpretation:** Parse and execute RPAL programs.
- **Syntax and Semantic Analysis:** Check the syntax and semantics of RPAL code.
- **Expression Evaluation:** Evaluate arithmetic, logic, and control flow expressions.
- **Error Handling:** Detect and report errors in RPAL code.


## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The primary programming language used for building the RPAL interpreter.
- **ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition):** Used for parsing RPAL code and generating the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).


## Getting Started

To get started with the RPAL Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/NadunSanjeevana/RPAL-interpreter.git
